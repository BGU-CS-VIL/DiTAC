### Requirements
- python 3.12
- torch 2.2.2 
- difw 0.0.29
- scikit-learn 1.5.1

`difw` can be fragile, make sure that it compiles successfully. We've successfully compiled it with cuda version 12.2. 

Note that you might have to update c++ compiler and/or paths, e.g.:
```sh
conda install cxx-compiler -c conda-forge
export CPATH=/usr/local/cuda-12/targets/x86_64-linux/include:$CPATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12/targets/x86_64-linux/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12/bin:$PATH
```

### How to use
You can import the activation layer and use it within your network.
```python
import torch
from ditac import DiTAC

act = DiTAC()
x = torch.randn(8,32,20,20).to('cuda')

act(x)
```

You can recreate Fig. 1 using the sample code:
```sh
python run_regression.py
```

**Other experiments' code will be uploaded soon**
